This command shows the impact of composition changes on existing XRs in the cluster.

It finds all XRs that use the specified composition(s) and shows what would change
if they were rendered with the updated composition(s) from the file(s).

Examples:
  # Show impact of updated composition on all XRs using it
  crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml

  # Show impact of multiple composition changes
  crossplane-diff comp comp1.yaml comp2.yaml comp3.yaml

  # Show impact only on XRs in a specific namespace
  crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml -n production

  # Show compact diffs with minimal context
  crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml --compact

  # Include XRs with Manual update policy (pinned revisions)
  crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml --include-manual

  # Collapse each changed composition to a single change-marker line (human output only;
  # JSON/YAML keeps full detail), keeping the affected XRs and downstream diffs
  crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml --minimize-composition

  # Show eventual state with function-sequencer (all stages, not just first).
  crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml --eventual-state

  # Evaluate affected composites even for a composition identical to the cluster's
  # (skipped by default). Useful as a "is my cluster converged?" baseline before editing.
  crossplane-diff comp unchanged-composition.yaml --analyze-on=always

  # Only evaluate composites when the composition's spec changes, skipping the render-per-composite
  # cost for metadata-only edits. Note those still create a new CompositionRevision.
  crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml --analyze-on=spec-change

  # Limit impact analysis to specific composites (by [namespace/]name)
  crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml --resource=default/my-claim
  crossplane-diff comp updated-composition.yaml --resource=default/xr-1,default/xr-2

Notes:
  --resource cannot be combined with --namespace.
  Composites with Manual update policy are surfaced with status "filtered"
  (reason "manual_policy") unless --include-manual is also passed. Composites with an
  Automatic update policy whose compositionRevisionSelector does not match the diffed
  composition's labels are surfaced with status "filtered" (reason
  "revision_selector_mismatch"); --include-manual does not re-include them, since they
  would not select the resulting revision. Composites that are being deleted are excluded
  entirely (reason "deleting"): Crossplane tears their composed resources down rather than
  composing them, so they never adopt the resulting revision. --include-manual does not
  re-include these either.

  A composition identical to its in-cluster version is reported as unchanged and its composites
  are not evaluated: applying it creates no new CompositionRevision, so nothing could adopt
  anything. Any downstream delta found in that situation is caused by something other than the
  composition (drift, convergence lag, or a modeling artifact of this tool), and cannot be told
  apart from a real impact — so it is not reported as one. Pass --analyze-on=always to evaluate
  anyway.

  "Identical" means identical in everything Crossplane hashes into a composition's identity —
  labels and annotations as well as spec. A composition differing only in metadata does get a new
  CompositionRevision, which composites re-point to, so it is evaluated by default. Use
  --analyze-on=spec-change to skip that evaluation; revisionImpact in JSON/YAML output still
  reports the revision either way.
