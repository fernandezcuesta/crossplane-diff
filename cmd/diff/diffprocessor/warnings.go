// WarningLogger is the advisory channel: a logging.Logger decorator that treats every Info call as a
// user-facing warning, writing it to stderr immediately and collecting it for structured output.
// Debug calls are forwarded to the wrapped logger unchanged.
//
// # Why the logger, and why Info
//
// A warning has to be raisable from wherever it is discovered — a client, a resource manager, the
// render loop. The logging.Logger is the only cross-cutting dependency already threaded to all of
// those; every component factory in ProcessorConfig takes exactly one (a client, a converter, and a
// Logger), so a parallel "warning sink" parameter would mean churning every constructor, every
// factory signature, and every With*Factory option for no semantic gain.
//
// There is no Warn to reach for: crossplane-runtime's logging.Logger has exactly two levels by
// design ("Crossplane prefers not to use go-logr because it desires a simpler API with only two
// levels ... Info and Debug"), and it defines Info as "messages that Crossplane operators are very
// likely to be concerned with when running Crossplane" against Debug's "when debugging Crossplane".
// So treating Info as the advisory level is not a convention invented here — it is the interface's
// documented meaning, which this type implements by giving those messages somewhere to go. What it
// does add is the second sink: the same message also lands in structured output.
//
// The user-facing label is deliberately WARNING rather than INFO. An operator reading
// "INFO: applying this diff will assume ownership" would under-weight it; the upstream *level* and
// the word shown to a human are answering different questions.
//
// # Why it writes to stderr itself
//
// Raising the wrapped logger's verbosity would surface warnings for humans, but in zap's
// development-mode format (timestamp, level, caller) and still nowhere in structured output. Owning
// the human rendering here means one mechanism produces both views — the same dual-emission contract
// OutputError follows — and the text stays fit for a CLI. Info is therefore NOT forwarded to the
// wrapped logger; otherwise a --verbose run would print every warning twice, once in each format.
//
// A zero WarningLogger is not usable; construct one with NewWarningLogger.
